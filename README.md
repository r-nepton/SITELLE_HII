# SITELLE_HII
Tools for SITELLE datacubes on Galaxies, HII regions, and more.
May 1st, 2017 (project in construction)

The goal of this project is to help any SITELLE'users to analyze efficiently their datacubes.
In order to properly extract the information fron the spectra of your target (HII regions, planetary nebulae, galaxy, etc.), multiple steps are required (sky subtraction, dissociate contribution from different sources,  source identifications, define apperture of multiple sources, extract and fit integrated spectrum, fitting integrated spectra, etc.). 
You will find here some routines very usefull to deal with datacubes, extract physical parameters, and produce nice plot of the results.
You are welcome to participate in this project by adding comments and tools you have built for similar purposes.
